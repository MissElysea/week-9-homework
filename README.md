PRACTICAL

1. Open the terminal using node server.js to ensure that the server is up running.
2. The server will start listening on port 3000.
3. Access the Greeting routes by visiting 'http://localhost:3000/greeting' and 'http://localhost:3000/greeting/your-name' in your web browser.
4. Access the route by visiting 'http://localhost:3000/tip/100/20' in your web browser. The page will display the tip amount as '20' in the heading.
5. Access the route by visiting 'http://localhost:3000/magic/YourQuestionHere' in your web browser. The page will display your question and a randomly chosen Magic 8 ball response.
6. Access the route by visiting 'http://localhost:3000/fibonacci/8' (replace '8' with your desired number) in your web browser. The page will display either "Very good. It is a Fibonacci number." or "I can tell this is not a Fibonacci number."

THEORETICAL

1. wordOccurrence: The time it takes to count the occurrences of a word in a phrase depends on the length of the phrase.
2. bubble_sort: The time it takes to sort a list using bubble sort depends on the length of the list.
3. factorial: The time it takes to calculate the factorial of a number depends on the value of the number.
4. bobIsFirst: Checking if the first element in an array is equal to 'bob' takes the same amount of time, regardless of the array size.
5. isPalindrome: Checking if a string is a palindrome depends on the length of the string.
6. sumOfDivisors: Calculating the sum of divisors for a number depends on the value of the number.
7. printAllNumbersThenSumPairs: Printing all numbers in an array and summing pairs of numbers depends on the length of the array.
8. isPrime: Checking if a number is prime depends on the value of the number.
